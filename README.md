## Let 's start !

We present to you the “Employee’s Happiness Tracking Tool” or EHTT, to speed
things up.
EHTT, is an application that helps the user to track the happiness level of the
people related to their company.
Each person will have the following properties:

  ● Name
  ● Category ( Employee or Manager)
  ● Company Name
  ● Happiness Level

We want you to list the people and allow searching through them by their name or
category. The results should also include the logo of their company and the
possibility to be sorted by happiness level, category or company in an ascending
or descending order.

We also want users to select which people to track, like a favorite list, to check
how they evolve. We recommend showing the favorite list inside a modal that can
be easily accessed by the navbar.

In the favorites modal, I want to be able to search by name, category and
company and have the possibility to remove the people from the favorite list,
without having to close it.

Try to use pagination for the listings ! We recommend showing 5 at the time.

## Provided material

You’ll be able to find all the required data at the following url.

It contains a JSON file with the information and an “images” folder with the
company’s logo.

## Delivery requirements

You can use any strategy you prefer for storing the favorites list and persistence is
not required. You must attach your solution in a single zip file or provide them by
a git private repository. The solution must run properly and a text file with any
instruction required for compiling and/or running it should be provided.

## Delivery extra (not required)

  ● Any UX or UI improvement you want to develop will be taken into
  consideration.
  ● It would be awesome to know if you didn’t have the time to complete the
  exercise or if you would do something different if you had more time.
